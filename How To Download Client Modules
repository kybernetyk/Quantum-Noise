So you want to build a download module for your child porn hosting service?

Here's how:

1. look at QNDownloadOperation
2. subclass that bitch
3. get it to work (logging in, passing the cookie, downloading the file)
	logging in + passing the cookie - that's most likely the only part you will have to implement
	downloading the file - the super class should do it ... but if you have some really retarded kind of stupid
							login scheme  then you will have override this one too to pass the login state
	
	
							
look at QNHotfileDownloadOperation.h/m - it is a pretty primitive 
download module as there's no fancy shit going on. 
just log in and pass the cookie (through using curl's internal cookie store.)


the rapidshare module is pretty much complex as there's an API and filechecking code
and the cookie string has to be extracted from the API ...


yeah more to come ...
