So you want to build a download module for your child porn hosting service?

Here's how:

1. look at QNDownloadOperation
2. subclass that bitch
3. get it to work (logging in, passing the cookie, downloading the file)
	logging in + passing the cookie - that's most likely the only part you will have to implement
	downloading the file - the super class should do it ... but well I was too tarded to build a general
							cookie passing method so you most probably will have to override the 
							- (BOOL) performFileDownload method to set the cookie as a header.
							look at QNHotfileDownloadOperation.h/m - it is a pretty primitive download module
							as there's no fancy shit going on. just log in and pass the cookie (through
							using curl's internal cookie store.)
							the rapidshare module is pretty much complex as there's an API and filechecking code
							and the cookie string has to be extracted from the API ...


yeah more to come ...
