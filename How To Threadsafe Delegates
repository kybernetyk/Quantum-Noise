If you should ever want to send a delegate messages from a thread that is not the delegate's main thread, don't send them directyl with
	[myDelegate aMessage];

Use -performOnMainThread: instead! Many Cocoa classes are main thread only and you NEVER know if your delegate might be using them. If your delegate
manipulates the UI then -performOnMainThread: IS THE ONLY WAY to send messages to the delegate. Cocoa's UI is NOT THREADSAFE and it is MAIN THREAD ONLY!

example:

	[delegate performSelectorOnMainThread: @selector(downloadOperationDownloadProgressDidChange:) 
							   withObject: self 
							waitUntilDone: NO];

or use the dd_invokeOnMainThread helper message from "NSObject+DDExtensions.h" to send messages with more than one argument!
