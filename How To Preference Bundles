Hai, this will tell you how to create preference pane Bundles!

1. Make a copy of an existing preference pane in the project's directory (WITH FINDER!)
2. Edit the source file names and contents in the copy to reflect your new pane's name.
3. Rightclick 'Quantumnoise' in the Groups&Files view and select 'Add new Target -> Loadable Bundle'
4. Add the folder to your XCode project. (Drag & Drop from finder to xcode.) Don't check 'copy files'. 
	->>>> Select your newly created Target in the dialog!!!! <<<<-
5. Select the QuantumNoise Target -> Get Info. Add your new Target to the 'Direct dependencies'-list.
6. Now it's time to change the .nib and the XXX-Info.plist of your bundle to reflect the changes.

7. When you're ready to test your preference pane, open 'QuantumNoiseAppDelegate.m" and edit add your pane to
	- (IBAction) openPreferencesWindow: (id) sender
		->
		[preferencesWindowController setPanesOrder:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"General", @"Updating", @"Your Pane's Name", nil]];	
		
	your pane's name can be set in
		YourPaneController.m
			- (NSString *)paneName;
